## Tattoo Design

[Aleph null](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleph_number) is the symbol for a small infinity in set theory which thematically ties to Whitman's *Song of Myself* ("I am large; I contain multitudes") as a symbol for my endeavors to tie the concrete and rational (the engineering side of myself) with the artistic and the ineffably beautiful (the creative side of myself) -- the intangibles of thought, art, time, creativity, and so forth. In a sort of meta-symbolism, I also see a parallel for that concept (containing the multitudes, specifically with combining the rational and the intangible) in the design itself, which unifies beautiful poetic art and concrete mathematical notation.

#### From *Song of Myself*, Walt Whitman (Section 51)

*Do I contradict myself?

Very well then I contradict myself,

(I am large, I contain multitudes.)*
